            <h3 id="idea">The Idea</h3>
            <p>Every day we experience much more complex emotions than those we can most easily give a name to. In literary and philosophical texts we find descriptions of emotions, or feelings, or moods that go beyond traditional models. So it is necessary to go beyond what already exists to formalize without trivializing, therefore in a sophisticated way, the humanistic perspectives in order to study and exploit them more effectively.</p>
            <p>So the purpose of this project is twofold:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>to identify the theories of current emotions, how to give a formal characterization by bringing examples from the literature and from other projects on the subject;</li>
                <li>to propose an ontology of those emotions to which we have not yet given a name and for which there is no taxonomy or classification, thus giving formal characterization to these new, emerging concepts. It is a question of creating a formal model (i.e. an ontology of the contexts of emotion) to describe the emerging emotions (more precisely, their contexts). Therefore, showing what is in the state of the art and what is missing to develop a model instead that allows both to describe an emotion starting from a vocabulary, and, possibly in the future, to recognize it in the text.</li>
            </ol>



            <h3 id="existing">What's Already Out There: the Need to Reuse and not Reinvent the Wheel</h3>
            <p>This section presents the <b>existing models</b> of description of emotions, as well as some <b>theories of cognitive-affective science</b> that underlie these models plus a particular case of a theoretical model that does not yet have a formalization.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this part of the project is to <b>identify what is there, what can be reused and what is missing in defining an emotion</b>. If most of the existing models share the same principles and if they are exhaustive and <b>consistent both from a formal and content</b> point of view.</p>

            <h4>Existing Ontologies</h4>
            <h5>1. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24279-3_14">EMO / MFOEM Emotion Ontology</a></h5>
            <p>Developed by the <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology) Foundry group</a>, which is a community which develops interoperable ontologies for the <b>biological sciences</b>.</p>
            <p>It’s an ontology of affective phenomena such as emotions, moods, appraisals and subjective feelings, designed to support interdisciplinary research by providing unified annotations. The ontology is a domain specialisation of the broader Mental Functioning Ontology.</p>
            <p>The emotion process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>is an <b>affective process</b>;</li>
                <li>has agent an organism;</li>
                <li>involves:
                <ul>
                    <li>an <b>appraisal process</b> which rises a a cognitive representation which represents an evaluation of the relevance of some triggering object or event to the organism</li>
                    <li>an emotional <b>behavioral process</b>: behaviour of the organism in response to the appraisal, which includes the </li>
                    <li>characteristic facial expressions for particular emotion types</li>
                    <li>a <b>physiological response</b> to emotion process: a bodily process which encompasses all the neurophysiological changes caused by the appraisal, which take place in the central nervous system (CNS), neuro-endocrine system (NES) and autonomous nervous system (ANS)</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>occurs with <b>consciousness</b>;</li>
                <li>realizes a <b>mental disposition</b>;</li>
                <li>has an <b>object</b>;</li>
                <li>gives rise to an <b>action tendency</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So the basic idea is that every emotion process involves these <b>4 + 1 components</b>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>appraisal</b>: e.g. the appraisal of suddenness gives rise to the emotional process which is called surprise;</li>
                <li><b>subjective emotional feeling</b>: an affective representation that the organism has about its own emotion (representations are always about something), e.g. feeling nervous;</li>
                <li><b>action tendency</b>: a disposition to behaviour that inheres in an organism by virtue of the physical changes brought about by an emotion process. e.g., smiling;</li>
                <li><b>physiological response</b>: bodily process which encompasses all the neuro-physiological changes caused by the emotion, e.g. shivering, becomig pale, heart beating at a fast race;</li>
                <li><b>emotional behavioral process</b>: not an actual component but rather an outcome of the emotion process. It’s the behavior of an organism in response to the emotion and as a result of the emotional action tendency which I referred to in the previous slide.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The emotion process is linked to but distinguished from: an emotional personality trait, an affective representation, and emotional action tendency, and an emotion disposition.</p>
            <p>The Emotion Ontology has been developed within the Basic Formal Ontology framework, to <b>support interdisciplinary research into emotions and other affective phenomena</b> in fields such as cognitive neuroscience, behavioral psychology, psychiatry, literary analysis, and artificial intelligence. The ontology provides a common language effectively, since the terms and relations in an ontology are provided with <b>logical definitions</b> which enable reasoning with the data.</p>

            <p>The background here are the <b>healthcare services</b>, particularly patient-provider interaction, which often involve highly emotional situations, and it is important for physicians to understand and respond to their patients’ emotions to best ensure their well-being.</p>
            <p>This ontology is based on the Ortony, Clore, & Collins’ models of emotions ("<b>the OCC model</b>"), which differentiates 22 emotions depending on the <b>psychological scenario that causes the emotion and the subsequent affective reactions</b> that appear. The OCC model proposes that emotions are comprised of a <b>collection of behaviors</b> rather than independent entities that then cause the behaviors. This model describes <b>emotions based on situations</b> rather than on patterns of physiology, neurology, experience, expression, and motivation is more straightforward and reliable for computers to understand. Additionally, the OCC model organizes emotions into <b>three categories: those concerning consequences of events, actions of agents, and aspects of objects</b>.</p>
            <p><b>VEO is aligned with EMO</b> of MFOEM, although it does not consider all the emotions categorized in the latter.</p>
            <p>Emotions are defined by <b>valence, hierarchically and semantically</b> (e.g. Satisfaction is a subclass of Joy).</p>
            <p>Finally, the emotion is defined as <b>"an affective state of conciousness"</b></p>

            <h5>3. <a href="https://wndomains.fbk.eu/wnaffect.html">WN-AFFECT: a WordNet extension</a></h5>
            <p>While not an emotion ontology, WN-AFFECT is an <b>extension of the WordNet ontology with annotations that describe the emotional valence of words</b> based on the W3C lists of emotions. In particular, to some synsets where assigned <b>affective labels</b> such us ‘emotion’, ‘mood’, ‘trait’ + extension of a set of <b>additional a-labels</b> (called emotional categories), hierarchically organized.  In a second stage, synsets were distinguished according to emotional <b>valence</b>, defining four additional a-labels: positive, negative, ambiguous, and neutral. Another important property is the <b>stative/causative dimension</b>: an emotional adjective is said causative if it refers to some emotion that is caused by the entity represented by the modified noun (e.g. amusing movie); while an emotional adjective is said stative if it refers to the emotion owned or felt by the subject denoted by the modified noun (e.g. cheerful/happy boy).</p>

            <h5>4. <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00908543/PDF/PID2998689.pdf">EmOCA: Emotion Ontology for Context Awareness</a></h5>
            <p>EmOCA is an emotion ontology for describing and reasoning on <b>emotion context</b> in order to improve <b>emotion detection based on bodily expression</b>. Context is incorporated into the <b>two-factor theory of emotion</b> (bodily reaction plus cognitive input) to demonstrate the <b>importance of context in the emotion experience</b>. In attempting to determine emotion felt by another person, the bodily expression of their emotion is the only evidence directly available, eg, “John looks angry”.</p>
            <p>The motivation behind the ontology creation is to <b>bring context into the emotion-modulating cognitive input</b>, eg, we know that John is a generally calm person, so we can conclude from expression (anger) plus context (calm) that John is not only angry, but that “John must be furious”. The choince of the ontology as a tool is due to the aim of bringing context into the implementation of the emotion detection process.</p>
            <p><b>Two-factor theory</b>: this theory proposes that after perceiving a <b>stimulus</b> (internal eg, souvenir or external eg, real world object), a person first experiences an immediate <b>bodily reaction</b>, and secondly a <b>cognitive process</b> is launched which uses the bodily expression and cognitive valuation <b>to define their emotion</b>.</p>
            <p>Emotions used in the ontologies are <b>Elkmann’s 6 basic emotions</b></p>

            <h5>5. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279324794_EmotionsOnto_an_Ontology_for_Developing_Affective_Applications">EmotionsOnto: an Ontology for Developing Affective Applications</a></h5>
            <p>EmotionsOnto is a generic ontology for <b>describing emotions and their detection and expression systems taking contextual and multimodal elements into account</b>. Once formalized as an ontology, the knowledge about emotions can be used in order to <b>make computers more personalised and adapted to users’ needs</b>. The ontology has been validated and evaluated by means of an applications based on a emotions-aware Tangible User Interface (TUI).</p>
            <p>First assumption: <b>the focus are emotion detection and expression systems instead of modelling internal emotion processing</b> in humans. Second assumption: the emotion is conceived as <b>Emergent Emotion (full-blown)</b> in <b>Scherer-Douglas-Cowie list of affective states</b>, defined as: "<b>states where the person’s whole system is caught up in the way they react to a particular person or situation</b>". Aspects involved are: valence, impulses to act or express, distinctive changes in the body, short duration. EmotionsOnto is based on a <b>generic model</b> geared towards capturing the entities that take part in the Emergent Emotion process.</p>
            <p>The ontology can help <b>implementing emotion-aware applications based on a wider range of theoretical approaches</b>. This flexibility and wide applicability of EmotionsOnto is in great part due to the fact that it is capable of <b>modeling contexts</b>. In order to do that, the <b>DOLCE upper ontology is reused and extended</b>, particularly the Description and Situation concepts. Descriptions correspond to the representations for the situations, which then trigger and are associated with emotions. Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering has also been chosen for cognitive aspects. Situations associated with emotions are stated to be modeled with <b>FrameNet</b>. FrameNet can be easily connected with DOLCE since the concept Frame appears as a subclass of Description.</p>

            <h5>6. SOCAM affective extension (Ontology Based Affective Context Representation)</h5>
            <p>Focusing on the context, this is an <b>ontology-based representation of the affective states for context aware applications</b> which allows expressing the complex relations that are among the affective states and between these and the other context elements.</p>
            <p>Emotions are subdivided in 2 main subclasses: <b>basic and secondary</b>. The Secondary has as subclasses a number of items that application-specific. <b>Activation-evaluation model</b>: each secondary state has a membership degree value for each of the basic state considered. The membership degree is expressed for each of the two following axes: <b>valence</b> (how positive, negative or neutral the state is) and <b>activation</b> (how dynamic the state is). The third axis measures the <b>intensity</b> of the state as in using values as low, medium, high. Since the affective states are considered to be permanently changing, a representation of <b>time</b> for an affective state is provided too.</p>

            <h5>7. Emotional Cues Ontology</h5>
            <p>It's a multimodal ontology: it is an <b>ontology based on emotional cues that uses media properties from different sources to model emotion</b>. It uses a generic approach to modeling emotional cues, so it is theoretical-system independent.</p>
            <p>It presents 3 modules representing three layers of emotions' detection or production: the emotion module, the emotional cue module, and the media module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>emotion module</b>: defines emotions as represented with emotional cues;</li>
                <li><b>emotional cue module</b>: describes external emotional representations in terms of media properties (change of tone has media: voice/sound). Every emotion can have one or more emotional cues, represented in different media. Emotional cues can be simple (verbal, conductal, physiological) or complex (integration of two or more cues);</li>
                <li><b>media module</b>: describes basic media properties important for emotional cues. This relation among emotional cues and media properties can be parameterized, enabling different settings for different emotional cues. Media is described with either simple media properties (e.g., intensity of sound), or derived (e.g., variations in the intensity of sound).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS is BOTTOM-UP PROCESS: it is possible to define emotions as composed of complex emotional cues, which are composed of other simple emotional cues, which are based on some media properties.</p>
            <p>The PRODUCTION OF EMOTIONS is TOP-DOWN PROCESS: we detect simple media properties, and then derive complex media properties. By analyzing complex media properties, we get simple emotional cues, and by combining these cues, we get complex emotional cues, which represent some emotion.</p>



            <h4>Existing models</h4>
            <h5>1. Underlying theories</h5>
            <p>For most of the ontologies or vocabularies proposed there are some theories underlying them. The most relevant are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Categorical emotional models</b>: emotions are defined in discrete categories, such as happiness, sadness etc;</li>
                <li><b>Dimensional emotional model</b>: emotions are defined according to dimensions, such as valence, arousal and control;
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Lang's dimensional emotional model</b>: Lang also proposed analyzing of emotions according to three systems involved in the expressions of emotions: subjective or verbal information, behavioral or conductal, psycho-physiological answers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>The OCC model (Ortony, Clore, & Collins’ models of emotions)</b>: states that the strength of a given emotion primarily depends on the events, agents, or objects in the environment of the agent exhibiting the emotion;</li>
                <li><b>Elkmann’s 6 basic emotions</b>: through a series of studies, Ekman found a high agreement across members of diverse Western and Eastern literate cultures on selecting emotional labels that fit facial expressions. Expressions he found to be universal included those indicating wrath, grossness, fear, joy, loneliness, and shock;</li>
                <li><b>Scherer-Douglas-Cowie list of affective states</b>: Attitudes, Established emotion, Emergent Emotion (full-blown), Emergent Emotion (suppressed), Moods, Partial emotion (topic shifting), Partial emotion (simmering), Stance towards person, Stance towards object/situation, Interpersonal bonds, Altered state of arousal, Altered state of control, Altered state of seriousness and Emotionless.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>2. Theories without a formal model yet</h5>
            <p>Among all the emotion theories that have not been translated to a formal model, there is one that is more interesting because of its significant conceptual difference: the <b>Theory of Constructed Emotion</b>.</p>
            <p>Presented by psychology professor and neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett in her book <i>How Emotions Are Made</i>, it contradicts many of our most firmly held ideas about how human emotions work. Indeed, some of this unusual statements can bu used to build a <b>Conceptual Model</b> since they are the most relevant for the theory. For example, it argues that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emotions cannot be detected through facial expressions or any other physiological measurement;</li>
                <li class="red">Emotions don’t have any Expressor.</li>

                <li>There are no "universal" emotions across people, nations, or cultures. Each one of us constructs their own emotions based on their personal experiences, although we can share it with others;</li>
                <li class="red">All emotions are subjective and based on personal experiences. We can share emotions with others.</li>

            <h3 id="alignment">Frame-based Alignment of Existing Ontologies: Approaching FrameNet</h3>
            <p>Since we do not have the complete structure for each ontology mentioned, and almost no logical formalization for them, a complete and exhaustive alignment is not possible, but an attempt may be useful to <b>detect elements in common in the definitions of the concept of emotion</b>. Considering the lack of axiomatization and of declaration of logical types defined within the ontologies collected, the approach chosen to find correspondences between ontology entities is <b>frame-based</b>: we want to <b>express the intensional meaning of the models, abstracting from logical types</b> (Aspirino et al., 2017). Thus, we will follow the method explained in: Luigi Asprino, Valentina Presutti, Aldo Gangemi, and Paolo Ciancarini. 2017. Frame-based ontology alignment. In Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'17). AAAI Press, 4905–4906.</p>
            <p>In order to do a frame-based alignment, we will use <b>FrameNet</b>: a project housed at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California which produces an electronic resource based on frame semantics. Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) is a formal theory of meaning based on the idea that human can <i>better understand the meaning of a single word by knowing the relational knowledge associated to that word</i> (Aspirino et al., 2017). A <b>semantic frame</b> can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event, relation, or object and the participants in it. <b>Frame elements</b> (FE) provide additional information to the semantic structure of a sentence. Each frame has a number of core and non-core FEs which can be thought of as semantic roles. Indeed, <b>a frame can be considered as “unit of meaning” for ontologies, and can be exploited as a means for representing the intensional meaning of the entities</b>.</p>
            <p>In this ontology alignment we will <b>focus only on the entity of "emotion"</b>, to find out if there is something that all these models have in common and which is therefore factually fundamental in describing an emotion – in order to <b>distinguish the essential elements to describe the meaning of the concept (frame) from the merely descriptive ones</b>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this alignment, however, is not strictly that of making the entities of different ontologies correspond, but rather that of <b>identifying the most important frames (and their respective elements) to define the concept of emotion</b>, i.e. those common to several annotations of the entity it represents in any ontology taken into consideration. Eventually, frames evoked by these entities will be compared to the frame elements of the <b>Emotion frame in FrameNet</b>.</p>

            <h4>1. Selecting frames evoked by annotations</h4>
            <p>In this first step, for each ontology selected from the bibliographic search, <b>the words that evoke the frames representing the meaning of emotion are extracted from the annotation</b> of the entity "emotion". When neither the annotation nor the comment were present, the definition was taken from the refering journal article. Taking into account the entity's comment and annotation allows us to disambiguate the meaning of the word. The selection of the evoked frames takes place <b>exploiting the frames FrameNet as mentioned, but also the synsets of WordNet</b>. <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> is a large lexical database of English: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. WordNet has been used to find synonyms / hyponyms / hypernyms of keywords retrieved in the annotation of the entity, in the case that exact keyword is not present on FrameNet. </p>

            <h4>2. Mapping frames and ontologies</h4>
            <p>In order to identify the effective mapping between ontologies and frames, we go through ontology entities and for each entity we compute any possible <b>mapping between the entity and the frames selected in the previous step</b> (i.e. those evoked by its annotations). In frame semantics, a frame is characterized by its roles (also called frame elements) and each element possibly define the semantic type of the individual that can play that role in the frame.</p>
