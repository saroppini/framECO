<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
FramECO is a proposal for a <b>new ontological model in OWL-DL, frame-based, to describe the context of emotions</b>. Because emotion has a complex context in which it fits, which goes beyond some of the most famous - and overcome - theories in the affective sciences, especially if we take into consideration some unusual emotions, which do not yet have a common name. For this reason framECO is located at the crossroads between the affective sciences or neurosciences and the humanities: identifying and formalizing the context of an emotion can serve not only to categorize it, but above all to identify it in literary and philosophical texts.</span>
