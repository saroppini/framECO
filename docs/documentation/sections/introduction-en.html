The state of the art of the existence of ontologies or models for describing emotions is complex and highly differentiate. Mostly, ontologies are built on theories, but there are some which are declared to be theoretically-independent from any theory. However, most of them lack in accuracy regarding ontology formalization. Frame-semantics resources like FrameNet, on the other hand, allow for a better description of the emotion context, but lack in a rigorous formalization too. FramECO is an attempt to overcome these shortages on the formal point of view, but keeping consistency and accuracy in the content. FramECO was developed not only to classify emotions, but rather to retrieve them in natural language texts, i.e. identifying an emotion in a literary text through automatic parsing for annotation and sentiment analysis. For this reason, the ontology mainly define what an emotion is, which elements of the context are always present when having an emotion experience, and what is the relation of the emotion with them.
