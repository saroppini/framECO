The most important class in framECO is the Emotion class, which is a subclass of the AffectiveState class. The definition of the Emotion class is provided through its description with constraints and enumeration. Indeed, existential and universal restrictions were used to define those elements that are necessarily present when there is an emotion (e.g., equivalent to the intersection of Affective state and hasCircumstance some Circumstance); while cardinality restrictions were used when necessary on some properties (e.g. hasExperiencer exactly one Experiencer). Valence is instead an enumerated class. All the other classes in framECO were defined in function of the Emotion class, but framECO could be easily expanded to include other concepts and become an ontology of affective phenomena in general - without radically changing the structure it now has.</span>
